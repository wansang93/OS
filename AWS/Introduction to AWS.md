## The Power of AWS

Invention requires two things
1. The ability to try a lot of experiments
2. not having to live with the collateral damage of failed experiments

> Andy Jassy - CEO AWS

**You can literally provision really complex environments**

- **AWS Global Infrastructure**
  - It's the actual physical infrastructure of Amazon Web Services.
  - It's the physical stuff that AWS runs on.
  - We really break it down into three different areas.
  - Regions, Availability Zones, and Edge Locations.
  - **Regions**
    - Region is basically a place in the world where AWS resources exist.
    - Region is a geographical area.
  - **Availability Zones**
    - Each region consists of two or more availability zones.
    - An availability zone is simply a data center.
    - An availability zone could technically be a collection of data centers, but basically they're facilities that are very, very close to each other, and each availability zone is spaced away from another availability zone.
  - **Edge Locations**
    - An edge location is basically a content delivery network(CDN) endpoint for CloudFront.
    - CDN 's a way to cache or to cache
    - What is CDN? (KOR) Link -> [https://goddaehee.tistory.com/173](https://goddaehee.tistory.com/173)

- **Services**
  - **Network and Content delivery**
    - **VPC**
      - It stands for Virtual Private Cloud.
      - VPC is like a virtual data center.
      - You have a VPC in all the different regions around the world.
    - **Route 53**
      - Route 53 is Amazon's DNS service.
      - 53 is the DNS port.
      - You can actually register domain names through Route 53.
    - **CloudFront**
      - CloudFront used to be in the storage section of AWS.
      - But they moved it over to networking and content delivery now.
      - For example
        ```
        We have Direct Connect and Direct Connect as a way of connecting up your office or connecting up your physical data centers to AWS directly using a dedicated line, dedicated telephone line.
        So instead of going over the internet, you're going over a dedicated line into AWS, and there's a few reasons you want to do that it might be around security but most of the time.
        it's because you need a very reliable internet connection, because you're pushing a lot of data up to AWS and down from AWS, and then you would use Direct Connect.
        Direct Connect can come up in the exam here and there.
        It's not a huge feature of the exam, but it can come up.
        It does feature very heavily in the Advanced Networking Specialty Exam.
        ```
  - **Compute**
    - **EC2**
      - EC2 stands for elastic Compute Cloud.
      - EC2 is simply the virtual machines that run on AWS.
    - **EC2 Container Service**
      - EC2 Container Services is basically a highly scalable, high performance container management service that supports Docker containers.
      - It basically allows you to run applications on a managed cluster of Amazon EC2 instances.
    - **Elastic Beanstalk**
      - If you don't know anything about AWS, and you want to deploy your code up into Amazon Web Services, you can actually just upload it to Elastic Beanstalk.
      - Elastic Beanstalk will then have a look at your code.
    - **Lambda**
      - It is basically one of the most revolutionary services of cloud computing.
      - You'd be able to login using SSH or RDP, if it was windows. And you'd be able to install things on this.
      - Lambda is what we call serverless.
      - So you don't actually go into the operating system, you don't do anything with the underlying host at all.
    - **Lightsail**
      - It's basically out-of-the-box cloud.
      - So if you want a WordPress site or Joomla site, for example, Lightsail will deploy that for you automatically.
